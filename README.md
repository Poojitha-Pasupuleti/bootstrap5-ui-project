## 🎯 **Objective**
The goal of this project is to explore **Bootstrap 5** and design **clean, modern, and responsive web pages** using its components.  
The focus is on **visual appeal, responsiveness, and component synergy**, not just template reuse — every section is built with creative customization.

## 🧩 **Project Overview**
This project showcases a **multi-page responsive website** developed using **HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5**.  
Each page demonstrates structured layouts, consistent UI, and a smooth user experience.

| Page | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 🏠 **Home** | Features a responsive navbar, hero carousel, and feature cards. |
| ℹ️ **About** | Describes design principles, goals, and UI inspiration. |
| ✉️ **Contact** | Includes a validated contact form with a success popup modal (frontend only). |

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **HTML5** | Defines page structure |
| **CSS3** | Adds custom styling and responsiveness |
| **Bootstrap 5** | Provides responsive grid and UI components |
| **JavaScript (Vanilla)** | Handles form validation and modal interactivity |
| **VS Code** | Development environment |
| **Git & GitHub Pages** | Version control and live project deployment |

## 🧠 **Technical Development Process**

### 🧩 Step 1: Setup & Structure
- Created modular folders: `assets/css`, `assets/js`, `assets/img`, and HTML files.  
- Linked **Bootstrap 5 CDN** and **Bootstrap Icons** for UI elements.

### 🎨 Step 2: Designing the Layout
- Built a **dark glassmorphism UI** for a modern, clean look.  
- Implemented **carousel** using Bootstrap’s components.  
- Added **cards** with hover effects to highlight content.

### 🧰 Step 3: Adding Functionality
- Added **form validation** using simple JavaScript checks.  
- Integrated **Bootstrap modal** for successful form submission feedback.  
- Prevented form reload using `event.preventDefault()`.

### ⚙️ Step 4: Responsiveness & Testing
- Tested across multiple screen sizes for smooth adaptability.  
- Used Bootstrap breakpoints (`col-md`, `col-lg`, etc.) for layout optimization.  
- Adjusted typography and spacing for better mobile readability.

## 🐞 **Common Bugs & Solutions**

| 🧩 Issue | 🔍 Cause | 💡 Solution |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Carousel images misaligned | Different image dimensions | Used `object-fit: cover` for uniform display |
| Navbar not collapsing | Missing Bootstrap JS | Added Bootstrap JS bundle before `</body>` |
| Modal not opening | Incorrect modal ID reference | Fixed with correct `data-bs-target` attribute |
| Hover effects on contact page | Shared global styles | Used page-specific CSS classes |

## ⚡ **Performance Optimization**
- Compressed images under **1 MB** for faster loading.  
- Minimized CSS by leveraging **Bootstrap utility classes**.  
- Used **semantic HTML** for accessibility and SEO benefits.  
- Ensured **fast, responsive performance** across all devices.
