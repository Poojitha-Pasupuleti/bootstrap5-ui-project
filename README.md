## 🎯 **Objective**
The objective of this project is to explore **Bootstrap 5** and design **clean, modern, and responsive web pages** using its components.  
The focus is on **visual appeal, component synergy, responsiveness**, and **creative UI customization** — not mere template reuse.

## 🧠 **Technical Development Process**

### 🧩 Step 1: Setup & Structure
- Created modular project folders: `assets/css`, `assets/js`, `assets/img`, and main HTML files.  
- Added **Bootstrap 5 CDN** and **Font Awesome** for icons.

### 🎨 Step 2: Designing the Layout
- Built a **dark glassmorphism UI** with subtle glow effects.  
- Used **Bootstrap grid system** for clean alignment.  
- Added **carousel**, **feature cards**, and **footer**.

### 🧰 Step 3: Adding Functionality
- Integrated **FormSubmit** for backend-free contact form handling.  
- Added **Bootstrap modal popup** for form submission success.  
- Made cards **clickable** and accessible.

### ⚙️ Step 4: Responsiveness & Testing
- Tested across mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- Adjusted breakpoints (`col-md`, `col-lg`, etc.) for better flow.  
- Fixed overlapping content and hover inconsistencies.

## 🐞 **Common Bugs & Solutions**

| 🧩 Issue | 🔍 Cause | 💡 Solution |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Carousel images misaligned | Image ratio mismatch | Used `object-fit: cover` |
| Navbar collapse not working | Missing attributes | Added `data-bs-toggle` and `data-bs-target` |
| Modal not showing | Missing JS CDN | Added Bootstrap JS before `</body>` |
| Hover effects on contact page | Shared CSS selector | Created `.contact-card` override |
| FormSubmit redirect | Default form behavior | Used JS `preventDefault()` to trigger modal manually |
